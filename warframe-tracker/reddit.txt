This is a web application that keeps track of some important data (foundry projects, wikia shortcuts, web shortcuts) with a clock that shows Cetus-related times.  
This has been a passion project of mine for over two months, and my first big project that uses JavaScript extensively. I never really used JS for anything but simple show/hide buttons - every method, every line of code and every frustrating hour spent finding a bug\* was a learning experience. 

Current features:  
- Wikia list: a simple text field that lets you jump to whichever Wikia article's title you've entered. You can also save frequently visited articles.  
- Foundry projects: keeps track of items you want to build, their components, drop locations/relics, and owned/required quantities. Also provides links to the items' Wikia articles.  
- Cetus clock: shows in-game time of day, and real world time left until sunset/sunrise.  
- Web shortcuts: generic links to online resources and websites.  
- Under development - more to come!

I made the entire app with Steam's in-game browser in mind (as a home page), for players with low-end computers that can't run a browser like Firefox or Chrome in the background.  
As such:  
- All data is stored locally, on the client browser. Very little static data is loaded from the host. (for nerds like me: I used `localStorage`)  
- There are no images. All graphics are highly optimized SVG files.  
- I've implemented background images, but they're disabled at the moment for legal reasons. When I re-enable them, the user can choose not to activate the feature, in which case the images won't be loaded.  
- Light and dark themes.  
- I tried to make the layout clutter-free while also keeping it aesthetic. Only relevant data is shown in the main section. The clock, the web shortcuts and the settings were placed in a sidebar.  
- Since all data is stored locally, syncing it between browsers or computers is tedious at best, but more on that later.  
- No ads, no analytics, no CDNs (except the font file), no unnecessary third-party scripts.  

Future plans:  
- A better way to sync data between browsers. Github Pages doesn't run PHP scripts, so cross-origin is the only way.  
- Binomial calculator to calculate various probabilities (e.g. relic shares).  
- Mobile support maybe?
