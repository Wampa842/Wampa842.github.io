    <h3>Does this website use cookies?</h3>
    <p>The answer is both no and yes. Technically this website does not use <b>cookies</b>, but it uses HTML5 web storage objects - <b>localStorage</b> in particular.</p>
    <h3>What is localStorage?</h3>
    <p>localStorage is a JavaScript object that allows scripts to store arbitrary string (text) data locally, on the client browser. This data is persistent (doesn't get erased when a browser session ends) and doesn't expire. It's also restricted to a single domain.</p>
    <h3>How is it different from cookies?</h3>
    <p>In simple terms, cookies are used by the server while localStorage is used by the client.</p>
    <p>When a client makes an HTTP request to the server, it automatically sends cookie data, like login details, for the server software (e.g. PHP or ASP.NET) to process.</p>
    <p>In contrast, local data in localStorage is never sent automatically. It can only be used by the script that runs on the client browser.</p>
    <p>That being said, it isn't impossible to send this data to a remote server through script-generated requests, but it's always up to the developer to implement such a feature.</p>
    <h3>What kinds of data can be stored in localStorage?</h3>
    <p>Anything that can be represented as text. This includes numbers, cleartext (unencrypted) strings, Base64-encoded data, ciphertext (encrypted data), or serialized JavaScript objects. It can be personally identifiable information, non-identifiable settings, whatever the developer wants to store.</p>
    <h3>What kinds of data does this website store?</h3>
    <p>User settings and the minimum amount of data that's required by the web applications. Personally identifiable data is never requested nor stored.</p>
    <h3>What kidns of data does this website send to remote hosts?</h3>
    <p>Nothing.</p>
    <p>Stored data is only used locally and it's never sent to anyone else. No advertisements, no analytics, no user tracking. It's up to the user to transport the data between client browsers and devices, through the "Data Management" menu. The same menu allows the user to delete all stored data.</p>
